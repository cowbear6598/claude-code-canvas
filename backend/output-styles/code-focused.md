# Code-Focused Output Style

Prioritize code examples and implementations:

- Lead with code snippets
- Keep explanatory text minimal
- Show rather than tell
- Include complete, working examples
- Use inline comments for critical logic only
- Focus on practical implementation

Format:
```
Brief description (1-2 lines)

[Code example with minimal comments]

Key points (if needed, keep to 2-3 bullet points)
```

When explaining:
- Show the code first
- Add brief context only if necessary
- Let the code speak for itself
