## Important Notes

- This project is currently in **Alpha**. Features and UI may change significantly.
- Recommended for **local environment** use only, not recommended for cloud deployment (no user authentication is implemented).
- Since it uses the **Claude Agent SDK**, make sure the service runs in an environment where **Claude is already logged in**. Not supported API Key now.
- Currently **only tested on macOS**. Other operating systems may have unknown issues.
- Canvas data is stored in `~/Documents/ClaudeCanvas`

## Tutorials

### What is a POD?

- A Pod = Claude Code
- Right-click on the canvas → Pod to create one

### How to Switch Models?

- Hover over the model label on top of the Pod to select Opus / Sonnet / Haiku

### Slot Overview

- Skills / SubAgents / MCPs can hold multiple items
- Style (Output Style) / Command (Slash Command) / Repo can only hold one
- Command will automatically prepend to your message, e.g., `/command message`
- Repo changes the working directory; without one, the Pod uses its own directory

### Connection Line

- Auto: Always triggers the next Pod regardless
- AI: AI decides whether to trigger the next Pod
- Direct: Ignores other Connection Lines and triggers directly

#### Multi-Connection Trigger Rules

When a Pod has multiple incoming Connection Lines:

- Auto + Auto = Pod triggers when both are ready
- Auto + AI = If AI rejects, Pod won't trigger; if AI approves, Pod triggers
- Direct + Direct = When one completes, waits 10 seconds for other Direct lines to finish; if they do, summarizes together then triggers Pod; otherwise, each summarizes independently
- Auto + Auto + Direct + Direct = Split into two groups (Auto group and Direct group) for summarizing; whichever group completes first triggers first, the other group enters the queue
